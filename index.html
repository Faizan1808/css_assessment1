    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

    <ol class="a" >
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br><br>
        
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper ,or in other media.</li>
        <br><br>

        <li><b><del> Css is not neccesary </del><span class="yel"> CSS saves lot of work.</span></b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <br><br>
        
        <li><ins> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files. </ins></li>
    </ol>


    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul class="b">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element link to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="yel"> in this 
            tutorial we will use inline  and internal styles,</span> because this is easier  to demonstrate, and easier
            for you to try yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing  CSS class and Id, the diffrence is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.
        ID,on other hand,applies  a style  to one  unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL
        to directly to  an element  and it's  used by JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
        In CSS,selectors are used to  target a specific element or range  of element on a web page. Once  an element  has been
        targeted, a style or set of  styles  can be applied  to the  element. 
    </p>

    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are Class and ID. Both are used to target element
        to which a style should be applied.
